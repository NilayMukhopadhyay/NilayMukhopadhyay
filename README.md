# Nilay Mukhopadhyay - Data Analyst

## Introduction
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nilay Mukhopadhyay, as a Data Analyst/Business Intelligence (BI) Analyst, I specialize in creating interactive dashboards, automating reports, and optimizing project efficiency. I leverage tools such as Power BI, SQL, Excel, Amazon Redshift, Azure Data Factory (ADF), and Microsoft Fabric. My role involves supporting data-driven decision-making and enhancing business outcomes for various departments, including Audit, HR, and Management.

With a BA (Bachelor of Arts) degree, I have a strong foundation in analytical thinking, problem-solving, and communication. I am passionate about learning new technologies and tools to enhance my data visualization and analysis capabilities. I am dedicated to collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams and delivering high-quality results that meet the needs and expectations of stakeholders.

## ðŸ“Š My Top 3 Projects
1. [**My Fitness Tracker**](https://mavenanalytics.io/project/12232)
   - **Tools Used:** [**Power BI**](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNDZhNmQ3NDEtNWNlZS00OTg5LTlmZTQtZmFiZmRjNzg0ZjY2IiwidCI6ImRmODY3OWNkLWE4MGUtNDVkOC05OWFjLWM4M2VkN2ZmOTVhMCJ9), [**Google Sheets**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q31VzzQqrFvSAnjwB6HWgU6X2ovlu5vZ9-ClpZQD9q4/edit?pli=1#gid=0), Microsoft Fabric, and [**SQL.**](https://github.com/NilayMukhopadhyay/Fitness-Tracker)
   - I started walking to get fit, but consistency was a problem. Then, a friend suggested using a Power BI dashboard with my walking data from Samsung Health. It made tracking my progress fun and helped me stay on track. This project was born out of my personal fitness goals. I hope you enjoy browsing it as much as I enjoyed making it.


2. [**Ski Pass Affordability in Europe and Asia**](https://mavenanalytics.io/project/5083)
   - **Tools Used:** Power BI, ChatGPT, Excel, and PPT.
   - The objective was to help users find their perfect winter getaway considering factors like budget, location, and timing, presented through an Interactive Exploratory Dashboard. Notably, the budget-friendly ski pass prices in Europe and Asia caught my attention, prompting a more in-depth analysis.

3. [**Customer Segmentation Analysis**](https://mavenanalytics.io/project/5084)
   - **Tools Used:** Power BI and SQL.
   - The primary objective of this study is to reveal meaningful patterns using the RFM methodology and to predict potential factors that may influence customer churn in the future.
