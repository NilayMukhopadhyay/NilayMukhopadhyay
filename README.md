# Nilay Mukhopadhyay - Data Analyst

## Introduction
With a Bachelor of Arts background, I bring a unique blend of analytical thinking and creativity to data solutions. Over the past 4+ years, Iâ€™ve grown into a results-driven Data Analytics Engineer, designing scalable BI solutions and automating analytics workflows using Power BI, SQL, Excel, and Microsoft Fabric. 

I specialize in turning complex datasets into actionable insights through interactive dashboards, semantic models, and dataflows. My work has delivered global, cross-functional reporting solutions and driven over $150,000 in annual operational savings through data-driven efficiency and automation.

## ðŸ“Š My Top 3 Projects
1. [**My Fitness Tracker (Power BI & Fabric)**](https://mavenshowcase.com/project/12232)
   - **Tools Used:** [**Power BI & Microsoft Fabric**](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNDZhNmQ3NDEtNWNlZS00OTg5LTlmZTQtZmFiZmRjNzg0ZjY2IiwidCI6ImRmODY3OWNkLWE4MGUtNDVkOC05OWFjLWM4M2VkN2ZmOTVhMCJ9), [**Google Sheets**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q31VzzQqrFvSAnjwB6HWgU6X2ovlu5vZ9-ClpZQD9q4/edit?pli=1#gid=0), Microsoft Fabric, and [**SQL.**](https://github.com/NilayMukhopadhyay/Fitness-Tracker)
   - I started walking to get fit, but consistency was a problem. Then, a friend suggested using a Power BI dashboard with my walking data from Samsung Health. It made tracking my progress fun and helped me stay on track. This project was born out of my personal fitness goals. I hope you enjoy browsing it as much as I enjoyed making it.


2. [**Ski Pass Affordability in Europe and Asia**](https://mavenanalytics.io/project/5083)
   - **Tools Used:** [**Power BI**](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZmQyZDc5Y2QtOWFkYS00NjI3LWEyYmMtNzNjNzY4NmFjODZkIiwidCI6ImRmODY3OWNkLWE4MGUtNDVkOC05OWFjLWM4M2VkN2ZmOTVhMCJ9), ChatGPT, Excel, and PPT.
   - The objective was to help users find their perfect winter getaway considering factors like budget, location, and timing, presented through an Interactive Exploratory Dashboard. Notably, the budget-friendly ski pass prices in Europe and Asia caught my attention, prompting a more in-depth analysis.

3. [**Customer Segmentation Analysis**](https://mavenanalytics.io/project/5084)
   - **Tools Used:** [**Power BI**](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYjJiNjA1M2MtMWNhZi00NGFlLThjZDgtODBiNWU4NDZiYjJhIiwidCI6ImRmODY3OWNkLWE4MGUtNDVkOC05OWFjLWM4M2VkN2ZmOTVhMCJ9) and [**SQL**](https://github.com/NilayMukhopadhyay/Customer-Segmentation/tree/main).
   - The primary objective of this study is to reveal meaningful patterns using the RFM methodology and to predict potential factors that may influence customer churn in the future.
