# Nilay Mukhopadhyay - Data Analyst

## Introduction
With a Bachelor of Arts background, I bring a unique blend of analytical thinking and creativity to data solutions. Over the past 4+ years, Iâ€™ve grown into a results-driven Data Analytics Engineer, designing scalable BI solutions and automating analytics workflows using Power BI, SQL, Excel, and Microsoft Fabric. 

I specialize in turning complex datasets into actionable insights through interactive dashboards, semantic models, and dataflows. My work has delivered global, cross-functional reporting solutions and driven over $150,000 in annual operational savings through data-driven efficiency and automation.


## ðŸ“Š My Top 3 Projects

1. [**Azure Data Lakehouse Architecture (Bronzeâ€“Silverâ€“Gold) for RFM Analysis in Power BI**](https://mavenshowcase.com/project/5084)
   - **Tools and Services**
      - Azure Data Factory (ADF) â€“ Orchestrates ingestion pipelines from Blob Storage to ADLS Gen2.
      - Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) â€“ Primary storage for Bronze, Silver, and Gold datasets.
      - Azure Databricks (PySpark + SparkSQL) â€“ Data exploration, cleansing, enrichment, and dimensional modeling.
      - Power BI â€“ Consumes curated Gold Layer data for RFM segmentation and churn analysis dashboards.

   - **High-Level Overview**
      - The architecture enables scalable, automated customer segmentation using the RFM methodology, following the Medallion Architecture in ADLS Gen2.
      - It ensures seamless ingestion, transformation, and reporting with high data quality and minimal manual effort.
      - Key insights reveal that High Churn Risk and At Risk customers receive fewer discounts, and profit margins peak for purchase frequencies between 40â€“70 â€” turning the pipeline into a decision-making tool, not just a data workflow.


2. [**My Fitness Tracker (Power BI & Fabric)**](https://mavenshowcase.com/project/12232)
   - **Tools and Services**
      - Microsoft Fabric
      - Power BI
      - Google Sheet

   - **High-Level Overview**
      - I started walking to get fit, but consistency was a problem. Then, a friend suggested using a Power BI dashboard with my walking data from Samsung Health. It made tracking my progress fun and helped me stay on track.
      - This project was born out of my personal fitness goals. I hope you enjoy browsing it as much as I enjoyed making it.

2. [**Ski Pass Affordability in Europe and Asia**](https://mavenshowcase.com/project/5083)
   - **Tools and Services**
      - Power BI
      - Excel
      - ChatGPT
      - Power Point (PPT)

   - **High-Level Overview**
      - The dataset comprises 499 distinct ski resorts and serves as a valuable resource for individuals seeking to identify their ideal winter vacation destination.
      - It is presented through an Interactive Exploratory Dashboard, acknowledging that determining an appropriate location for skiing is influenced by various subjective factors such as budget, location, and timing, which may vary among users.
